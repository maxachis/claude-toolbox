# Explain Code

Provide a detailed explanation of how code works.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - File path, function name, or code concept to explain

## Instructions

Explain the code at multiple levels:

1. **High-level overview** - What does this code accomplish? Why does it exist?
2. **Step-by-step walkthrough** - Walk through the logic flow
3. **Key concepts** - Explain any patterns, algorithms, or techniques used
4. **Dependencies** - What does this code depend on? What depends on it?
5. **Gotchas** - Any non-obvious behavior or edge cases to be aware of

Use simple language. If the code uses advanced concepts, explain those too.
