# Accessibility Audit

Audit and fix accessibility issues in UI code.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Component or page to audit (or "full" for broader review)

## Instructions

1. **Audit for WCAG compliance**:

   **Perceivable:**
   - Images have meaningful alt text
   - Videos have captions/transcripts
   - Color is not the only indicator
   - Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 text, 3:1 large text)
   - Text can be resized without breaking

   **Operable:**
   - All functionality available via keyboard
   - Logical focus order
   - Visible focus indicators
   - No keyboard traps
   - Skip links for navigation
   - Sufficient time for interactions

   **Understandable:**
   - Labels for form inputs
   - Clear error messages
   - Consistent navigation
   - Predictable behavior

   **Robust:**
   - Valid HTML structure
   - ARIA used correctly
   - Works with assistive technology

2. **Check for common issues**:
   - Missing or empty alt attributes
   - Form inputs without labels
   - Buttons/links without accessible names
   - Incorrect heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3)
   - Missing landmark regions
   - Auto-playing media
   - Motion without reduced-motion support

3. **Review ARIA usage**:
   - Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA when possible
   - ARIA roles match element behavior
   - Required ARIA attributes are present
   - Live regions for dynamic content

## Output

- List of issues by severity (Critical, Major, Minor)
- Specific fixes with code examples
- Testing suggestions (screen reader, keyboard-only)
- Before/after comparisons for fixes
